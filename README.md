Burn injuries are marked by a prolonged and intricate inflammatory response that can last for months, making it essential to understand and predict their dynamics to improve treatment strategies
and outcomes. In this study, we explored post-burn immune response simulations using a hybrid model combining Finite volume and Cellular Potts model-based methods We analyze complementary parallelization 
strategies employed using CompuCell3D (CC3D) and MPI. Three unique parallelization strategies were explored, namely fully serial, partly parallel, and fully parallel combinations of CC3D-MPI implementations.
The simulation results provide critical insight into the performance of the model simulations for varying endothelial cell counts and processor numbers. The parallelized version consistently reduced the 
runtime by an average of 45 % compared to the partially parallel computations, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling larger workloads.
